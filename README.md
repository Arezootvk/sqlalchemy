# sqlalchemy-challenge
Hey there, and a warm welcome to Challenge 10's SQLAlchemy challenge repository! Inside this space, you'll find a folder affectionately named 'SurfsUps,' where the heart of our exploration lies. Here's what you'll discover within:

A cozy Jupyter notebook crafted specifically for 'Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data.'
An amiable Python script, lovingly named app.py, tailored for 'Part 2: Design Your Climate App.'
Wander into the 'Resources' directory, where all the essential materials for our journey are neatly tucked away. Feel free to grab what you need!
